# Critical Codebase Issues

## Simulation Components
1. **State Management in simulation-controls.tsx**
   - Potential race conditions in simulation controls
   - Missing loading states during operations

2. **Memory Leaks in resource-allocation-graph.tsx**
   - D3.js cleanup not properly handled
   - Event listeners not removed

## Toast System
3. **Toast Limit Handling in use-toast.ts**
   - TOAST_LIMIT may not be enforced properly
   - Potential memory leaks in toast queue

4. **Toast Display Issues in toaster.tsx**
   - Z-index conflicts with other UI
   - Animation performance problems

## Responsive Design
5. **Duplicate Mobile Hook Implementations**
   - use-mobile.tsx exists in both hooks/ and components/ui/
   - Inconsistent breakpoint handling

6. **SSR Compatibility**
   - Window object access in use-mobile without checks
   - Hydration mismatches possible

## Security
7. **Server Route Vulnerabilities**
   - Missing input validation in server routes
   - No rate limiting implementation
   - Insecure direct object references possible

## UI/UX
8. **Accessibility Violations**
   - Missing ARIA attributes in page.tsx
   - Color contrast issues in dark mode
   - Keyboard navigation gaps

## Performance
9. **Animation Jank**
   - Framer Motion overuse in multiple components
   - Unoptimized SVG icons

## Code Quality
10. **Duplicate Code**
    - Multiple implementations of similar hooks
    - Copy-pasted UI patterns

Note: These issues were identified through static analysis. Actual impact may vary based on runtime behavior.
